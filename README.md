This is an incredibly simple downloader script that can be used to download from HTTPS Live Streaming Sites that do NOT use encryption.

Supported site: *.zindex.eu.org/*

I would recommend YT-DLP for most popular media sites.

Requirements:

Python 3.x (I used Python 3.12.8 to run this).
An Internet Connection (How did you get here??)
Basic Understanding of how HTTPS Live Streaming Chunking works.

What does this script do exactly?

This script systematically organises parts of a file from a CDN site, and outputs the part files into a single file. It also features a download speed limiter to avoid interrupting other users on your network.
